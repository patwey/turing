## Chapter 7: Before you start, figure out if it's a hard skill or a soft skill

Hard skills are actions that are performed with machine-like precision. They are those that, ideally, are done exactly right all the time. When I look at what little I know about programming, some hard skills jump out. It seems that anything comprising the barrier between your desired task and the computer performing that task is a hard skill.  For instance, there are shell commands, keyboarding skills, language syntax, and keybindings.  Each of these things must be done exactly, because each character matters.  Missing a simple character can be the difference between navigating to the right directory or writing code that runs and raising an error.

Soft skills have no clear correctness. Rather, a desirable result can be reached through multiple avenues.  They depend on on-the-fly reads and subsequently informed decision-making.  Where hard skills require rigid adherence to guidelines, soft skills benefit from flexibility and agility.  Soft skills for a developer could be working in a team or with a partner, offering advice or criticism, formulating a solution to a problem, or adapting a learning style to fit a teaching methodology.  Indeed, reading social cues and body language could be the difference between coming off as an asshole and helping out a teammate. Also, approaching how to assemble the hard-skill tools at your disposal to solve a programming problem requires you to shift and reassess as your understanding of the problem becomes more clear.

To apply this knowledge at Turing, I can focus on building the muscle memory and mental precision needed for hard skills through relentless practice.  Constantly writing code and navigating my computer with these skills in mind, as well as deliberately practicing them will help to solidify them in my subconscious.  To enable myself to make the proper reads required for the soft skills of being a student here, I can ensure that I enter each day/situation mindful and alert. In addition, I can enter each problem with a mind that's open to more than one 'right' solution, as well as an ego that's pushed aside.

## Chapter 8: To build hard skills, work like a careful carpenter

When you are building your hard skills, you have to go slowly and deliberately.  Precision matters, because each repetition paves the way for future action.  Furthermore, perfect each fundamental before moving on.

For me, this means applying the discipline necessary to move slowly and practice often. It means finding the grit to not just get something right once, but to get it right and then get it right three more times before moving on. For instance, taking the keybindings sheet and practicing it until I can navigate without thinking about what keys to press tonight, and then coming in early tomorrow to practice it again before class.

## Update: 8/28

- What is the biggest thing you could change that would improve your chances of success here?

I need to work on my ability to learn/problem solve collaboratively.  My initial impulse is to go off on my own for something that I don't know and not come back until I understand it better.  I think I could benefit myself and my classmates more by making my struggles more transparent both so that we can know we're not alone and so that we can grow together.

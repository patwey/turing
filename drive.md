1. *When do you hit your most unconscious flow, where your actions happen almost automatically?*

  I hit my most unconscious flow when I'm thoroughly 'warmed-up' and I'm engaged with a task.  Usually, I'm interested and engaged in solving the problem.

2. *Are there any dangers, problems, or weaknesses with that flow state? Is it healthy?*

  The danger I run into most often is that I work for long periods without breaks.  This pace is tough to sustain over the course of some tasks, and can lead to me burning out on larger projects.

3. *What motivates you to work? Why are you here at Turing, in the big picture, and why are you here today in the small?*

  It motivates me when I struggle with new ideas or projects that are given to me.  The struggle points me to an opportunity to improve, and the awareness of that opportunity motivates me to seize it.

4. *What's the purpose behind your motivation? We all have a need for survival, but you likely aspire to leave some kind of mark. What is it? Why?*

  Right now, my purpose is to test my own resolve in learning an entirely new skill that is an academic rather then physical expertise. I'm interested in testing my own limits, and that motivates me more than anything.

5. *What undercuts your motivation? When do you struggle to focus or achieve? What excuses do you use to make it ok to fail or procrastinate?*

  I find that exhaustion, mental and physical often wears me down to where I make exceptions for myself.  If I'm already tired, I'm more prone to accept failure, or take excessive time away from a task.  I tell myself that I need to recover, or the problem is too hard within the given constraints.

6. *What helps you do your best work? Why not do these things all the time?*

  Structured work time, free of distraction and with regular breaks helps me be focused and efficient.  My preparation before the actual work time has a huge impact on my work - getting enough sleep, eating right and exercising regularly helps.  I do my best work when I'm feeling good physically, not worn out or sluggish.

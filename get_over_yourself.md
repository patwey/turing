# Getting Over Myself

### Get Over Your Fear
I could benefit by participating more readily in class.  At times, I fear answering unless I'm totally sure, and that holds me back from complete engagement during class time

### Get Over Your Condescension
I don't think I have too much of a problem with this, however I could make an effort to be more readily available to help my classmates solve issues (if I am even capable of helping them - a large caveat).  I could block out some time to just roam around and help (maybe the length of a pomodoro).

### Get Over Your Predispositions
I ran into an instance of this today, actually.  I decided to try to use TDD when implementing my bubble sort, and it was going really slowly.  I was tempted to just solve the problem all at once and write the tests after. I had to force myself to think about coding in a test-first manner.
